## Skills

Over the past years, I gained profund knowledge in different areas of software and information technology.

#### RTC Jazz Extension Development
Since 2013, I use Rational Team Concert for Tracking, Planning, Source Code Management and Build Automation. Even more important on this is that I am writing extensions for RTC since then. Using Java, JavaScript and the Dojo Toolkit I've created half a dozen of company internal extensions, some of them interact with other internal applications like ClearQuest. I will start to contribute our knowledge back to the community on [Github](https://github.com/jazz-community)

#### ASP.NET MVC
I have more than a year of experience with ASP.NET MVC, gained with the [dog2go](https://github.com/innerjoin/dog2go) project and a Siemens internal application for meeting management and reporting.

#### Build, CI & CD
I have written build scripts with various build tools (Ant, Maven, MSBuild, Batch, Gradle, Grunt and Gulp). Maintaining Build Infrastructures using JBE and VSTS Build has also been in my responsibility.

#### University Knowledge
As I'm still studying at University, I have learned a few languages (JavaScript, Typescript, C, Modern C++, C#, Java). Skills in the area of Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Distributed Software System, Algorithms and Data Structures, Software Engineering Practices, Project Management, Leadership, Intercultural Competences and more define my profile.
